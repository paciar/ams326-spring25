fun(x) = e^(-x^3) - x^4 - sin(x)
For calculating FLOPS, I assume that Python uses exponentiation by squaring (optimized exponentiaion method).

FLOP counting:
    I approximated e^x to be +7 FLOPS, assuming we use Taylor series approximation of e^x with the first 4 terms.
    -x^3: +2 FLOPS
    x^4: +2 FLOPS
    sin(x): +1 FLOP
    Subtraction between all terms: +2 FLOPS
    TOTAL: 14 FLOPS

Arguments:
    x:  input x-variable

Returns:
    Result of f(x) using provided x-value.
